        <p class="work-subtitle">Methodist Church · The quiet close</p>
        
        <p>
            After the neon and sodium, the competing colours of commerce, the walk 
            ends here. The horizontal lines of the cladding create a meditation on 
            time and care — each plank aligned with its neighbour, the grey of 
            weathered wood speaking to decades of Yorkshire weather. Against this 
            patient backdrop, the white lettering makes its quiet declaration of 
            purpose. This is where the exhibition closes: not with spectacle, but 
            with stillness.
        </p>
        
        <h2>On Light</h2>
        <p>
            Two bulkhead lights flank the sign like sentinels, their warm glow creating 
            overlapping pools of illumination. The light source is practical — designed 
            for safety, for the evening congregation finding their way to the door — 
            but the effect is almost reverential. The sign floats in its own soft halo.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fixtures themselves tell a story: industrial, functional, chosen for 
            durability over aesthetics. Yet their warm colour temperature (perhaps 2700K) 
            speaks to someone's deliberate choice. This is not the cold white of security 
            lighting but something more welcoming, more domestic.
        </p>
        
        <h2>On Material</h2>
        <p>
            The horizontal timber cladding is an unusual choice for a Methodist church — 
            a denomination typically associated with solid stone and Victorian certainty. 
            This modernist intervention suggests a building extended or refurbished, 
            the congregation adapting to changed circumstances while maintaining their 
            presence in the town.
        </p>
        <p>
            The grey of the wood reads differently in different conditions: by day it 
            might appear silver, by late afternoon perhaps blue. Here, caught in the 
            warm artificial light, it takes on a bronze quality, as if the building 
            itself were generating heat.
        </p>
        
        <h2>On Typography</h2>
        <p>
            The lettering is clean, modern, sans-serif — a far cry from the Gothic 
            inscriptions of Anglican churches or the hand-painted signs of rural chapels. 
            This is a church that has made peace with the twentieth century, perhaps even 
            the twenty-first. The typeface says: we are still here, we have adapted, 
            we are accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            "St John's Methodist Church" — the apostrophe carefully placed, the spacing 
            considered. Someone ordered these letters, someone mounted them on the wall, 
            someone connected the lights. Each act a small prayer of maintenance.
        </p>
        
        <h2>On Meaning</h2>
        <p>
            Methodist churches occupy a particular place in Northern English towns. 
            Born of the industrial revolution, of Wesley's open-air sermons to miners 
            and mill workers, they were once the beating heart of working-class 
            spiritual life. Many have closed; those that remain are often sustained 
            by aging congregations and occasional letting of their halls.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the lights are on. On a Sunday evening in February, someone has ensured 
            the lights are on. This photograph catches a building in the act of 
            announcing its continued existence — modest, practical, still standing.
        </p>
